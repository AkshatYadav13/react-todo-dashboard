# Todo-Dashboard – React-Practice 

This is a **mini React practice project** built to demonstrate key React concepts like state management, component composition, searching, pagination, and conditional rendering. The app fetches a list of todos from an API, displays them in a paginated table, and allows searching and editing of todos.
